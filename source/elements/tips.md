Tooltips and infotips, collectively called tips, are used to provide additional context to a UI element.

## General usage
Use tips to provide the name of a control which doesn't contain text. For example, a control that only has an icon in it.  
![Alt text](images/elements/tips/tips-example-tooltip.svg)


If the element has a shortcut, provide the shortcut in the tip surrounded by parentheses.
<div class="do" markdown="1">
![Alt text](images/elements/tips/tips-shortcut-example-do.svg)  

Do
</div>

It isnâ€™t necessary to provide a tip for every control. Consider how useful a tip is for helping the user understand a command.
<div class="dont" markdown="1">
![Alt text](images/elements/tips/tips-control-dont.svg)  

Don't
</div>

## Choosing between a tooltip and an infotip
- Tooltips provide a concise label to help identify a UI element. If the user only needs the command name to understand what it is, then use a tooltip.
- Infotips are used to provide additional context to an item when helpful. If a command is seldom used or complex, an infotip can provide more information than a tooltip.

If the extra information provided by an infotip would be redundant, use a tooltip instead.

<div class="dont" markdown="1">
![Alt text](images/elements/tips/tips-hide-palette-dont.svg)  

Don't
</div>
In the example above, the extra content is redundant and unnecessary. A tooltip the describes either the control name or the description can be used to define what the control does but it doesn't need both.


If you need to provide the name **and** description of an element, use an infotip.

Don't rely solely on what other controls are using. Just because other elements are using a tooltip or infotip it isn't required that your tip use the same implementation. The part to keep consistent is providing the appropriate amount of information for the user. Make sure the information provided by a tip is useful and necessary.


## Tooltips
Tooltips provide the name or basic description of an element in a single line of text.

For truncated text, use tooltips to provide the full name.  
<div class="do" markdown="1">
![Alt text](images/elements/tips/tips-text-truncate-do.svg)  

Do
</div>
If a textblock is not truncated, don't provide a tooltip if it just repeats the text.  
<div class="dont" markdown="1">
![Alt text](images/elements/tips/tips-text-truncate-dont.svg)  

Don't
</div>


If the tooltip is providing additional information about an element, it is OK to show it even if the text is not truncated.  
<div class="do" markdown="1">
![Alt text](images/elements/tips/tips-tooltip-file-path-do.svg)  

Do
</div>

## Infotips
Do not include elements in an infotip that require the user to click. However, you can provide commands via key input to execute commands in the footer. This is typically used to provide a path to online help for a command.

Due to their extra content, infotips do not timeout so the user has time to read the information.
  - To accomplish this, set the `ShowDuration` property to a very large value, like `360000000`.

It isn't necessary to use a header in an infotip if it is simply repeating the text in the element. 
<div class="do" markdown="1">
![Alt text](images/elements/tips/tips-infotip-header-do.svg)  

Do
</div>
<div class="dont" markdown="1">
![Alt text](images/elements/tips/tips-infotip-header-dont.svg)  

Don't
</div>
**Exception:** In the palette we have chosen to always show the header in the infotip since the items are a closely related collection and the header sometimes varies from the name shown in the palette.
